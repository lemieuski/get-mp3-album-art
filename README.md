# get-mp3-album-art
Simple python script that uses google custom search to scour your music library and grab album art
Make sure to setup your google custom search (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com), save the search ID, and link it to your API (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis). 
Daily quotas of 100 queries won't be exceeded to save money. 

There are two versions of the script, one will hit each file and embed the artwork, the other will only hit each folder. 

enjoy!
